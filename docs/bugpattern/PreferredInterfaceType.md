Prefer referring to types by the immutable type (such as `ImmutableList`)
instead of the general collection interface type (such as `List`). This
communicates important [semantic guarantees][javadoc].

This is consistent with [Effective Java 3rd Edition ยง64][ej3e-64], which says to
refer to objects by their interfaces. Guava's immutable collection classes offer
meaningful behavioral guarantees -- they are not merely a specific
implementation as in the case of, say, `ArrayList`. They should be treated as
interfaces in every important sense of the word.

That is, prefer this:

```java
ImmutableList<String> getCountries() {
  return ImmutableList.of("Denmark", "Norway", "Sweden");
}
```

to this:

```java
List<String> getCountries() {
  return ImmutableList.of("Denmark", "Norway", "Sweden");
}
```

TIP: Using the immutable type for the method return type allows Error Prone to
prevent accidental attempts to modify the collection at compile-time (see
[`DoNotCall`]).
